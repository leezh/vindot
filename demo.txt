:<LeeZH> Hello there!
:<LeeZH> Welcome to Vindot - Visual Novel Godot - a tech demo for dialogue trees, written in the Godot engine.
:<LeeZH> It is largely inspired by Ren'py and Inklewriter but designed so that it works better with how Godot works internally.
:<LeeZH> The core of the program is `script.gd'. It interprets the dialogue script and processes its logic.
:<LeeZH> It's not a proper library - you're probably going to have to modify it to suit your game better.
:<LeeZH> Sorry for the mess. I mostly threw this together for the game I'm making.
:<LeeZH> The main point is that you can do lots of writing in pure text without having to faff about with various user interfaces.

:<LeeZH> So here is a quick rundown of the features.
:<LeeZH> Firstly, you can define multiple speakers in a ...
:<Stranger> Yeah! So that you can have multiple people talking in a conversation!
:<LeeZH> ...
:<LeeZH> Moving on, you can also leave out the speaker.
: Such as this here.
: This is useful for narrative parts.

:<LeeZH> Also, you can give players choices
> As a list of things
	$ choice_one
	: You picked the first option
> That you can pick
	$ choice_two
	: You picked the second option
:<LeeZH> Pretty neat isn't it?

@label_intro
:<LeeZH> There are also labels.
> Let's try it out!
	#jump label_go
> I'm done for now
	#jump label_done

@label_go
:<LeeZH> So you can jump back and forth in different parts of the script!
$ jump + 1
#if jump > 4
	:<LeeZH> You know, I think there's something wrong here.
	:<LeeZH> Some sort of anomaly, but I can't figure out what.
	:<LeeZH> Maybe if I rewound time so I can see it better ...
	:<LeeZH> Nah, that'd be crazy.
	: *crash*
	:<LeeZH> Hey! Cat! What are you doing!
	: *crash*
	:<LeeZH> Get off the table! Stay away from that button! It's da...
	: ...
#elif jump > 2
	:<LeeZH> Whoa, I'm getting a bit of deja'vu here.
	:<LeeZH> Maybe I should hit that rewind button ...
#else
	:<LeeZH> Let's rewind a bit.
#jump label_intro

@label_done
:<LeeZH> And finally, it's a bit clunky, but there are variables!
#if choice_one
	:<LeeZH> For instance, I can see that you picked the first choice earlier.
#elif choice_two
	:<LeeZH> For instance, I can see that you picked the second choice earlier.
:<LeeZH> I haven't actually gotten around embedding the variables in the text itself.
:<LeeZH> That said, I'd imagine it'd work different depending on how you're planning on using this.
:<LeeZH> Heck, for simple visual novels, such as this, it might not even be necessary.

:<LeeZH> So now, you're probably wondering why not just write a plain GDScript file?
> Yeah, I'm interested
> Nah, don't really care
	:<Stranger> Tell us anyway!
:<LeeZH> Okay. So, I could write the whole thing with coroutines and all that jazz.
:<LeeZH> Gives me full access to the entire engine. Great, right?
:<LeeZH> Now, what if I wanted to save the game mid-conversation? You can't with GDScript.
:<LeeZH> With this, as long as you remember the script being opened and two variables `data' and `node_pos' you can easily resume from where you left off.
:<LeeZH> Neat, huh?
:<LeeZH> Well, that's all for now. Bye!
